This directory contains sample data from the Drosophila melanogaster
chromosome 2L, allowing to try out LTRsift on a small data set. 

To use this sample data, an encoded sequence version of the genome sequence is
required. Please run the following to create this encoded sequence using
the following command in this directory:

$ ./prepare_encseqs

This will leave you with a set of ``dmel58.*'' files. The ``dmel58.esq''
file can then be specified in the LTRsift project creation dialog.
